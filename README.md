# Hi, I'm @GC2407CIZV

A passionate and results-driven individual exploring the world of data science and software development. I thrive on tackling challenging problems and crafting innovative solutions. My journey is one of continuous learning, with a current focus on deepening my expertise in data analysis and visualization.  I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning to real-world challenges.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my skillset with Google Advanced Analytics.

## Skills

* **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C
* **Data Science & Analytics:** Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Tableau, Posit Cloud, Mode, MySQL, Google Analytics
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree (from IBM project)
* **Data Visualization:** Plotly, Folium (from IBM project)
* **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup (from IBM project)
* **Tools & Technologies:** Visual Studio, DB Browser, Spreadsheet Software

## Projects

I'm continually building my project portfolio, showcasing my growing expertise in data science and software development.

* **ðŸš€ Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Success Prediction:**  Developed a machine learning model to predict Falcon 9 first-stage landing success, achieving 83.3% accuracy using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This project involved data collection via the SpaceX API and web scraping, extensive exploratory data analysis, interactive visualizations using Folium and Plotly, and model evaluation. Key findings included identifying the most successful launch site and analyzing the impact of payload weight and orbit type on landing outcomes.

* **ðŸ¦† Quacktastic Conundrum (CS50):** Developed a mystery game using Python and Flask, inspired by CS50's Fiftyville and The Hangover. Players use investigative skills to solve puzzles, navigate fictional social media platforms, and piece together clues to recover a missing mascot.  This project demonstrates skills in full-stack web development, database management (SQLite), security best practices (user authentication, input sanitization), and front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
