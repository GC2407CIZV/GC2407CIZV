A passionate and results-driven individual exploring the world of data science and software development. I thrive on tackling challenging problems and crafting innovative solutions. My journey is one of continuous learning, with a current focus on deepening my expertise in data analysis and visualization.  I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning to real-world challenges.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my skillset with Google Advanced Analytics.

## Skills

* **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C
* **Data Science & Analytics:** Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Tableau, Posit Cloud, Mode, MySQL, Google Analytics
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree (from IBM project)
* **Data Visualization:** Plotly, Folium (from IBM project)
* **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup (from IBM project)
* **Tools & Technologies:** Visual Studio, DB Browser, Spreadsheet Software

## Projects

I'm continually building my project portfolio, showcasing my growing expertise in data science and software development.

* **ðŸš€ Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Success Prediction:**  Developed a machine learning model to predict Falcon 9 first-stage landing success, achieving 83.3% accuracy using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This project involved data collection via the SpaceX API and web scraping, extensive exploratory data analysis, interactive visualizations using Folium and Plotly, and model evaluation. Key findings included identifying the most successful launch site and analyzing the impact of payload weight and orbit type on landing outcomes.

* **ðŸ¦† Quacktastic Conundrum (CS50):** Developed a mystery game using Python and Flask, inspired by CS50's Fiftyville and The Hangover. Players use investigative skills to solve puzzles, navigate fictional social media platforms, and piece together clues to recover a missing mascot.  This project demonstrates skills in full-stack web development, database management (SQLite), security best practices (user authentication, input sanitization), and front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

* **Olympic Games Data Analysis:** Analyzed over a century of Olympic data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to uncover trends in athlete demographics, medal distribution, and gender representation.  Explored relationships between physical attributes (age, height, weight, BMI) and athletic success across various sports. Key findings included the evolution of athlete demographics over time, the age distribution of medal winners, and gender disparities in sports participation.

* **Machine Learning:** *[Concise and compelling description of your machine learning project(s). What algorithms did you use? What were the results or key insights?]* Example: "Developed a predictive model for [problem] using Python and Scikit-learn, achieving 90% accuracy. Explored algorithms such as [list algorithms]."
* **Python for Everybody:** *[Describe a specific project or key takeaway from this course. What specific skills did you gain that you can apply?]* Example: "Completed the 'Python for Everybody' specialization, gaining proficiency in web scraping and data analysis. Built a web scraper to collect and analyze data from [website]."
* **Learn SQL Basics for Data Science:** *[Describe a project or how you've applied these skills. What type of SQL did you learn? What insights did you derive?]* Example: "Honed my SQL skills for data analysis, including complex queries and data manipulation. Used SQL to analyze [dataset] and identify key trends in [area]."
* **Google Analytics:** *[Describe a project or how you've used Google Analytics. What kind of analysis did you perform? What were the results or recommendations?]* Example: "Leveraged Google Analytics to analyze website traffic and user behavior. Identified key areas for improvement in [area], leading to a 10% increase in [metric]."
