##   Key Projects

* **ðŸš€ Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Success Prediction:**Â  Developed a machine learning model using Python and Scikit-learn to predict Falcon 9 first-stage landing success, achieving 83.3% accuracy with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This project involved data collection via the SpaceX API and web scraping using Beautiful Soup, extensive exploratory data analysis with Pandas, interactive visualizations using Folium and Plotly, and rigorous model evaluation.Â  Key findings included identifying the most successful launch site and analyzing the impact of payload weight and orbit type on landing outcomes.

* **ðŸ¦† Quacktastic Conundrum (CS50):** Designed and developed a mystery game using Python and Flask, inspired by CS50's Fiftyville and The Hangover. Players use investigative skills to solve puzzles, navigate fictional social media platforms, and piece together clues to recover a missing mascot.Â  This project showcases my skills in full-stack web development, database management (SQLite), security best practices (user authentication, input sanitization), and front-end development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

* **ðŸŒ¿ Bellabeat Smart Device Usage Analysis:** This data-driven case study leverages publicly available Fitbit data to provide actionable marketing recommendations for Bellabeat and their Leaf wellness tracker. I used R and the tidyverse package to analyze user trends in activity, sleep, and calorie expenditure, uncovering key insights into consumer behavior.Â  My analysis included data cleaning and transformation, exploratory data analysis using ggplot2, and the development of strategic marketing recommendations for product positioning, feature promotion, and target audience identification.Â  For example, I identified a significant correlation between weekday/weekend activity patterns and developed targeted marketing strategies based on these findings.

##   Other Projects

* **Olympic Games Demographics and Medal Distribution Analysis:** Investigated trends in Olympic athlete demographics and medal distribution from 1896 to 2020 using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. I cleaned and preprocessed a dataset of athlete information, medal counts, and sports data using Pandas. My analysis revealed a significant increase in female participation over time and explored the relationship between physical attributes and athletic success.
